He went on to win an NBA championship with the Mavericks in 2011 before signing with the Minnesota Timberwolves, where he played for the next three seasons. He has also played in the NBA Development League and the Baloncesto Superior Nacional. Barea was a member of the Puerto Rican national team that won the gold medal in the 2006 and 2010 Central American and Caribbean Games. He was the starting point guard for Puerto Rico when they won the gold medal in the 2011 Pan American Games and the silver medal in the 2007 Pan American Games. Barea was born in the municipality of Mayagüez in the west coast of Puerto Rico in 1984 to parents Marta (née Mora) and Jaime Barea.With an engineer father and a mother who was a retired professor as well as volleyball and tennis coach, he grew up in an upper-middle class neighborhood of Mayagüez.Barea was a member of Boy Scouts of America Troop 790 for seven years.In 2001, Barea started playing basketball for Indios de Mayagüez of the Baloncesto Superior Nacional (BSN).

As a senior in 2001–02, he averaged 20 points, 6 rebounds, 8 assists, and 3 steals in helping his team to the state title and a 38–2 record. He made a name for himself nationally at the City of Palms event in December 2001 where he was the team's leading scorer and showcased an accurate shot from three-point range.In April 2002, he enrolled at Northeastern University.After attending Northeastern University, Barea would return to Puerto Rico to rejoin Indios de Mayagüez for the 2002 BSN season; there, he averaged 2.8 points in 14 games.As a freshman playing for the Northeastern Huskies in 2002–03, Barea earned third-team All-America East Conference (AEC) and AEC All-Rookie team honors, after averaging a conference-leading 17 points to go along with 3 rebounds, 3.9 assists, and 1.9 steals in 28 contests. He became the first freshman in Husky basketball history to record 400 points and 100 assists in a season and accrued a team-high 25 games of scoring in double-figures. As a sophomore in 2003–04, Barea earned First Team All-America East honors after finishing second in that conference for both scoring (20.7 ppg) and assists (5.8 apg) and becoming the first Husky since Reggie Lewis in 1986–87 to average at least 20 points per game.

Barea broke the single-game and single-tournament assist records, as he dished out 18 assists for Beach Barton Ford in a 118–100 victory over Norfolk Sports Club, giving him 41 assists in three games. For his efforts, Barea received the tournament's first Allen Iverson A.I. award, given to the player deemed most important to his team. After the Portsmouth Invitational Tournament, Barea returned to Puerto Rico to join Cangrejeros de Santurce for the 2006 BSN season, where he averaged 10.4 points, 2.7 assists, and 2.8 rebounds over 9 games.After going undrafted in the 2006 NBA draft, Barea joined the Golden State Warriors for the 2006 Las Vegas Summer League where in five games, he averaged 6.8 points, 1.8 rebounds, 2.8 assists, and 2 steals in 21.4 minutes per contest. He then joined the Dallas Mavericks for the Rocky Mountain Revue where in three games, he averaged 12.0 points, 1.7 rebounds, and 6.7 assists in 25.0 minutes per game.

On November 4, 2006, he made his regular season debut for the franchise, recording two points in two and a half minutes of action during a 76–107 loss to the Houston Rockets. On January 17, 2007, Barea was assigned to the Fort Worth Flyers of the NBA Development League. On January 29, he was named the D-League Performer of the Week after he topped 40 points in two different games while leading the Flyers to a 3–1 record. On February 1, 2007, he was recalled by the Mavericks after he averaged 27.3 points, 5.0 rebounds, 7.8 assists, and 1.3 steals in eight D-League games. On April 13, 2007, Barea recorded a season-high 16 points in an 89–104 loss to the Utah Jazz.

Barea finished his rookie season with averages of 2.4 points, 0.5 rebounds, 0.8 assists, and 0.7 steals in 33 regular season games. He also played two playoff games for the Mavericks, scoring 0 points in three and a half total minutes. In July 2007, Barea re-joined the Dallas Mavericks for the 2007 Las Vegas Summer League, where in five games, he averaged 16.0 points, 2.5 rebounds, and 7.0 assists in 27.6 minutes per game. On November 3, 2007, he recorded a then career-high 25 points in a 123–102 victory over the Sacramento Kings. He went on to appear in 44 regular season games (with 9 starts) for the Mavericks in 2007–08 while averaging 4.3 points, 1.1 rebounds, and 1.3 assists in 10.5 minutes per game. He also managed one playoff game where he contributed eight points against the New Orleans Hornets. On July 9, 2008, Barea re-signed with the Dallas Mavericks to a three-year deal. In 2008–09, Barea's role on the team increased dramatically. Injuries to Jerry Stackhouse, Josh Howard, and Jason Terry saw Barea's minutes per game double as coach Rick Carlisle began regularly using a three-guard lineup which included Jason Kidd, Jason Terry, and Barea to spark an offensive streak in games. On February 20, 2009, Barea scored a then career high 26 points during an 86–93 loss to the Houston Rockets. In the 2009 playoffs, Barea became a starter during the first round, replacing Antoine Wright in an effort to contain Tony Parker of the San Antonio Spurs. He put up 13 points and added 7 assists in his first playoff start. In 2009–10, Barea again played an important role off the bench for the Mavericks. Over 78 games (with 18 starts), he averaged 7.6 points, 1.9 rebounds, and 3.3 assists in 19.8 minutes per game. He scored a season-high 23 points two times during the season and played in all six of the Mavericks' playoff games, where they once again fell to the San Antonio Spurs in the first round. In June 2010, the Mavericks exercised their $1.8 million 2010–11 team option on Barea's contract. In 2010–11, Barea played a career-high 81 regular season games, while averaging 9.5 points, 2.0 rebounds, and 3.9 assists in 20.6 minutes per contest. On January 1, 2011, he scored a then career-high 29 points during an 87–99 loss to the Milwaukee Bucks. In the second round of the 2011 playoffs, the Mavericks faced off against the defending champions, the Los Angeles Lakers. During the second game of the series, Barea converted 12 points coming off the bench to lead a fourth-quarter rally that secured the 93–81 win for Dallas. With the game already decided and 24 seconds remaining, Barea was clotheslined by Lakers' forward Ron Artest, for which Ron was subsequently suspended. After the game, the Lakers praised Barea's performance with Phil Jackson even comparing him to star point guard Chris Paul, while Kobe Bryant went on record saying that ""Barea kicked our asses"". The Mavericks won the final game of the series to advance past the Lakers. Barea was the second-leading scorer for his team, putting up 22 points to go along with 8 assists. At one point in the fourth quarter, Barea had darted down the lane and was in midair about to finish a layup when Lakers' center Andrew Bynum threw him an elbow; the flagrant foul caused Barea to fall down hard and Bynum to be immediately ejected. Barea recovered, however, and played the game to the end. He called the foul ""dangerous"". Initially Bynum was unapologetic about the incident, saying, ""We were getting embarrassed. They were breaking us down. So I just fouled somebody."" He later issued a formal apology to the league and to Barea. The NBA suspended Bynum for the first five games in the next season in consequence, but later shortened the suspension to four games due to the lockout-shortened season. The Mavericks advanced to the NBA Finals where they faced the Miami Heat led by Dwyane Wade and Lebron James. Coach Rick Carlisle decided to start Barea when they were down 1–2 in the series. Barea became a key player, being instrumental in changing the dynamic of the entire series and winning the next three games. The Mavericks defeated the Heat 4 games to 2 and so claimed their first NBA championship in franchise history. Barea became the second Puerto Rican player to ever win an NBA championship, following Butch Lee in 1980. Barea started in three of 21 playoff games that he played for the Mavericks, while averaging 8.9 points, 1.9 rebounds, and 3.4 assists in 18.6 minutes per game. After failed negotiations to re-sign with the Mavericks, Barea began looking elsewhere, but, because of the NBA lockout, he was unable to sign with another franchise. On December 14, 2011, following the conclusion of the lockout, Barea signed a four-year, $19 million contract with the Minnesota Timberwolves. On December 26, 2011, Barea made his debut for the Timberwolves, recording 14 points, 2 assists, and 2 rebounds in a 100–104 loss to the Oklahoma City Thunder. However, Barea's season was hampered with ankle and thigh injuries as he managed only 41 of 66 games for the Timberwolves in 2011–12. Despite this, on March 23, 2012, Barea recorded his first career triple-double, putting up 25 points along with 10 rebounds and 14 assists in a 149–140 loss to the Oklahoma City Thunder. During the last weeks of the season, and with injuries to starters Ricky Rubio, Kevin Love, and Luke Ridnour, Barea became the starting point guard, averaging 15.8 points and 9.4 assists during the last 9 games. During that period, Barea tallied a season-high 28 points and a career-high 15 assists. Barea began the season with 21 points and 5 assists against the Sacramento Kings on November 2, 2012. However, in his fourth game, he sprained his left foot, which caused him to miss the next five contests. In December, Barea averaged more than 25 minutes and 12.7 points per game coming off the bench. He had his best game of the season on April 12, when he scored 23 points against the Utah Jazz. He finished that season with averages of 11.3 points, 4.0 assists, and 2.8 rebounds in 23.1 minutes per game. In 2013–14, Barea served as the Timberwolves back-up point guard behind Ricky Rubio. He had his best offensive game in November 15, against the Denver Nuggets, scoring 21 points to go with 4 assists. In January, Timberwolves star Kevin Love indirectly criticized teammates Barea and Dante Cunningham for their behavior during game timeouts. Barea finished the season averaging 8.4 points and 3.8 assists per game. On October 27, 2014, Barea was waived by the Timberwolves in the hope of returning to the Dallas Mavericks. On October 29, 2014, Barea signed with the Dallas Mavericks, returning to the franchise for a second stint. In his first game back for Dallas the following day, Barea received a standing ovation from the American Airlines Center crowd as he entered the game off the bench during the first quarter. He went on to record 4 points, 4 rebounds, and 3 assists in the 120–102 victory over the Utah Jazz. On February 11, 2015, Barea scored a season-high 22 points on 8-of-15 shooting in a 87–82 win over the Jazz. On July 16, 2015, Barea re-signed with the Mavericks to a four-year, $16 million contract. On December 23, 2015, Barea scored a career-high 32 points on 13-of-20 shooting during a 119–118 overtime win versus the Brooklyn Nets. Three days later, he made a career-high seven three-pointers and finished with 26 points in a 118–111 win over the Chicago Bulls. On March 30, 2016, he scored 26 points, including a go-ahead layup with 49.9 seconds left as the Mavericks rallied in the fourth quarter to beat the New York Knicks, 91–89. On April 6, he helped the Mavericks secure their fifth consecutive victory by recording game-highs of 27 points and 8 assists during an 88–86 win over the Houston Rockets. Having become the Mavericks' sparkplug late in the season with Deron Williams sidelined, Barea suffered his own injury on April 8, a right groin strain which forced him to leave the contest against the Memphis Grizzlies after only eight minutes. The groin injury continued to bother him for the rest of the regular season and into the Mavericks' first round playoff series with the Oklahoma City Thunder. In the Mavericks' season-opener on October 26, 2016, Barea scored 22 points in a 130–121 overtime loss to the Indiana Pacers. On December 19, 2016, he returned to action after missing a month with a strained right calf. He finished with 11 points in 13 minutes against the Denver Nuggets. He went back on the injured list in January 2017; then after sitting out 20 games with a left calf strain, he returned to the hardwood in a 105–96 victory over the Brooklyn Nets on March 10, during which he added 9 points to 3 assists in 14 minutes of play. On February 24, 2018, in a 97–90 loss to the Utah Jazz, Barea hit his 500th 3-point field goal as a Maverick, becoming only the eighth player in franchise history to reach 500 made 3-pointers. On March 22, 2018, he had a season-high 23 points during a 119–112 loss to the Jazz. The game marked his 567th for the Mavericks and broke a tie with Mark Aguirre for the eighth-most in team history. On January 11, 2019, Barea suffered a torn right Achilles tendon in a contest against the Minnesota Timberwolves. He underwent surgery three days later. On August 19, 2019, Barea was re-signed by the Dallas Mavericks. Barea began his international career with Puerto Rico's Under-19 junior national team, participating in the 2003 FIBA Under-19 World Championship where he tied for third place in the tournament's Most Valuable Player poll. His next international performance occurred at Caguas, Puerto Rico, in the Under-21 Centrobasket tournament, in which Puerto Rico won the gold medal. Barea was awarded the Most Valuable Player award after leading the tournament in scoring, assists, and steals. His last participation at the Under-21 level was at the 2005 FIBA Under-21 World Championship, where he finished fourth in scoring with an average of 17.6 points per game and led the competition in assists with 7.3 per game, as Puerto Rico took seventh. In July 2006, Barea made his debut for the senior national team in the 2006 Central American and Caribbean Games, where Puerto Rico captured the gold medal. In the championship game against Panama, Barea drilled the decisive three-point basket with fourteen seconds left to give Puerto Rico a final advantage. Puerto Rico finished the tournament undefeated after six straight victories. Barea was then named the tournament's Most Valuable Player. He was the primary point guard for the Puerto Rican team that won the silver medal in the 2007 Pan American Games. Later that year, he played limited minutes in the 2007 FIBA Americas Championship, where Puerto Rico won the bronze medal. In 2008, Barea partook in a series of preparatory tournaments before the 2008 FIBA World Olympic Qualifying Tournament. In these exhibition games, he played in the starting lineup. The Olympic Qualifying Tournament began on July 14, 2008, with Barea returning to the back-up point guard position behind Carlos Arroyo. Puerto Rico advanced to the finals, but did not qualify to the 2008 Summer Olympics. In this tournament, Barea had averages of 12.4 points, 2.2 assists, and 3.2 rebounds per game. Barea continued playing backup point guard at the 2008 Centrobasket tournament and entered the final round leading the event in points, after scoring 31 and 30 against Panama and the Dominican Republic, respectively. In the last two games, Barea was promoted to the starting lineup. Puerto Rico went on to claim the gold medal of the tournament, by defeating the United States Virgin Islands, and Barea to receive its Most Valuable Player award. In 2009, the Mavericks declined to allow Barea to participate in the FIBA Americas Championship for fear that he might re-injure his left shoulder after having recently undergone post-season surgery to repair it. Barea returned to international play at the 2010 Centrobasket, serving as the national team's starting point guard, while Arroyo was moved to the regular shooting guard position. Puerto Rico ousted Panama in the semi-finals and the Dominican Republic in the finals to capture the gold medal. Barea averaged 13.8 points and led CentroBasket in assists per game, with 7; for his efforts, he clinched a spot on the All-Star Team for the tournament. Barea helped Puerto Rico take home a silver medal at the 2013 FIBA Americas Championship, and he was named to the All-Tournament Team. He was also on the roster of the national team that played in the 2014 FIBA Basketball World Cup. Although Puerto Rico would be eliminated in the Second Round, Barea finished as the World Cup Top Scorer during the First Round. He accumulated 110 points in 5 contests for an average of 22 points per game. Barea's scoring statistics proved above even such talents as Luis Scola, Andray Blatche, Pau Gasol, and Francisco García. On May 30, 2017, Barea was appointed the head coach of Indios de Mayagüez of the BSN. While listed as 6 ft 0 in (1.83 m) by the NBA, Barea's mother believes his actual height is around 5 ft 10 in (1.78 m).In a 2016 Wall Street Journal story, Barea said that when announced as being 6 feet in pregame player introductions, he sometimes had to stop himself from giggling ""because me and about 20,000 other people in the arena knew that was a lie."" In March 2011, Barea confirmed he was in a relationship with Miss Universe 2006 Zuleyka Rivera. In July 2011, they confirmed that they were expecting their first child. Rivera gave birth to their son Sebastián José Barea Rivera in February 17, 2012. Barea was present during the birth. The couple later split in April 2013. In the summer of 2013, Barea started dating actress and Miss Universe Puerto Rico 2011 Viviana Ortiz. In February 2016, they confirmed that they were expecting their first child. Their daughter Paulina Barea Ortiz was born in March 31, 2016. Barea and Ortiz got married on August 20, 2016, in a lavish ceremony at the church of the Universidad del Sagrado Corazón in San Juan, Puerto Rico. Five days after Hurricane Maria hit, Barea spoke to his parents on a family friend's phone to inform them that Mavs owner Mark Cuban lent him the team plane to fly down to Puerto Rico the next day with food, water, and supplies. The Mavs' team plane made the trip five times, delivering a total of more than 100,000 pounds of food, water, power generators, and other supplies. Barea made the trip once while his stay-at-home wife ran the other four trips and focused full time on the relief efforts. Barea's efforts in helping Puerto Rico earned him the NBA's J. Walter Kennedy Citizenship Award and the Hall of Fame's Mannie Jackson Award recognizing human spirit. Barea is 12 credits short of getting his college degree from Northeastern. His older brothers are Jaime, a doctor, and Jason, an engineer. Barea returns to his hometown Mayaguez only a few times a year, and usually stops first in Barrio Paris, a poorer part of town where his father used to drive daily to pick up his teammates. Before the hurricane, his foundation focused on refurbishing basketball courts in poor areas.

He played for the Arizona Wildcats in the Pac-12 Conference in the 2017–18 season and was a consensus five-star prospect in the Class of 2017, as well as a McDonald's All-American.Ayton was selected with the first overall pick in the 2018 NBA draft by the Suns. He was selected to the NBA All-Rookie First Team for the 2018–19 NBA season. Ayton was born in Nassau, Bahamas to Bahamian father Alvin and Jamaican mother Andrea.Ayton was first scouted by an Annual Bahamian basketball magazine called the Bahamian Basketball Yearbook.At the age of 12, Ayton was scouted by the All Bahamian Brand who were visiting Bahamas Academy High School, a tiny private school then located on Wulff Road in Nassau. The scouts came when Ayton, a tuba and soccer player, was at band practice, rather than basketball practice, but were impressed by his 6'5"" frame. Ayton moved to San Diego, California to play high school basketball. Ayton attended Balboa City School in San Diego, California and started on the varsity basketball team for two years. As a sophomore in 2014–15, Ayton led Balboa to a 17-14 record, averaging 21 points, 16 rebounds and 3.8 blocks per game. He racked up double-doubles in 21 of 22 regular season games. That summer, he averaged 16.5 points, 13.5 rebounds and 2.2 blocks a game for Supreme Court AAU (California) on the Under Armour circuit.As a standout in his class, he elected to transfer from Balboa City School to explore an opportunity at a Prep Academy. Ayton, now a junior in 2015–16, transferred to Hillcrest Prep Academy in Phoenix, Arizona to play out his last two years.During this high school year, he became teammates with another top-tier Class of 2017 player in 2018's #2 pick Marvin Bagley III. Throughout his junior year, Ayton averaged 29.2 points, 16.7 rebounds, 3.8 blocks per game. As a senior in 2016–17, Ayton led Hillcrest to a 33-6 record and national rankings across multiple outlets while averaging 26 points, 15 rebounds and 3.5 blocks. While representing the World Select team, Ayton played at the 2016 Nike Hoop Summit, chipping in with eight points to go along with seven rebounds.Ayton was considered one of the top prospects in the 2017 recruiting class by Scout.com, Rivals.com and ESPN. Ayton was rated as a five-star recruit and the No.3 overall recruit and No.1 center in the 2017 high school class. In 2015, he was ranked by Scout as the top prospect in all of high school in their ""Ultimate 100"" list. He had narrowed his choices between three schools: Arizona, Kansas and Kentucky. On September 6, 2016, Ayton committed to play for the Arizona Wildcats, and he signed his letter of intent. Ayton made his debut with the University of Arizona on November 10, 2017, recording 19 points, 12 rebounds, and 3 blocks in a 101–67 win over the Northern Arizona Lumberjacks. His 19 points was 7th most for a Freshman in an Arizona debut. Throughout his college career, he was used as a power forward instead of center; Dušan Ristić was Arizona's starting center instead. On December 9, 2017, Ayton recorded what was, at the time, a season-high 29 points and 18 rebounds in an 88–82 win over the Alabama Crimson Tide. On December 30, 2017, against the in-state rival Arizona State Sun Devils, he recorded 19 rebounds, which would be a season-high at the time. On January 20, 2018, against Stanford, he blocked 6 shots, which tied him for most in Arizona Freshman single game history. He had also recorded 17 20-point games and 23 double-doubles through 34 games. However, while Ayton had some great successes during his freshman season, there were also controversies mired during his last few months there. On February 23, 2018, a reported FBI wiretap revealed Arizona's head coach, Sean Miller, allegedly talked with Christian Dawkins (a key figure involved in the 2017–18 NCAA Division I men's basketball corruption scandal) to discuss paying Ayton $100,000 to allow him to enter the university, with the monetary situation being dealt with directly to him. While Miller would not be coaching the next game a day later against Oregon (assistant coach Lorenzo Romar would replace Miller that night), Ayton would still be allowed to play that day as the starting center. In that game, Ayton would record 28 points, 18 rebounds, and 4 blocks in the overtime loss to Oregon. The wiretapped conversation reportedly occurred in 2016, when Ayton was still attending the Hillcrest Prep Academy. Later on October 11, 2018, a government official revealed a now-former Adidas consultant named T.J. Gassnola paid a currently unknown amount of money to Ayton's family via Christian Dawkins in order to attend some Adidas sponsored programs. On May 2, 2019, federal prosecutors played a wiretapped call from June 20, 2017 between Dawkins and former assistant coach Emanuel Richardson that Miller was paying Ayton $10,000 per month while enrolled at Arizona. On March 3, 2018, after their last regular season home game against California, where he'd record 26 points and a career-high 20 rebounds in a 66–54 win over California, head coach Sean Miller honored Ayton, as well as underclassmen Rawle Alkins and Allonzo Trier, with confirmations that they'd all be entering the 2018 NBA Draft at the end of this season. On March 9, Ayton would record a career-high 32 points with 14 rebounds in a 78–67 overtime win against UCLA. He'd tie that career-high for points the next day alongside grabbing 18 rebounds in the Pac-12 Championship game against USC, where the Wildcats won 75–61. Ayton would be named the Pac-12 Tournament's Most Outstanding Player during the event. At the end of the regular season, Ayton was named both the Pac-12's Player of the Year and Freshman of the Year, as well as become a member of the All-Pac-12 first team (in terms of both regular voting and voting through the Associated Press) and be named the winner of the Karl Malone Award. He was also voted a consensus first-team All-American. Furthermore, Ayton was one of three freshman to be a part of the All-American First Team, joining Marvin Bagley III and Trae Young for the most consensus freshmen First Team members in a season. Following Arizona's upset loss to the University at Buffalo in the Round of 64 of the 2018 NCAA Men's Basketball Tournament, Ayton announced his intention to forgo his final three seasons of collegiate eligibility and declare for the 2018 NBA draft, where he was expected to be a top-tier lottery selection, if not the potential #1 draft pick. On April 26, 2018, Ayton announced he signed with agent Nima Namakian of BDA Sports. On June 21, 2018, the Phoenix Suns selected Ayton with the first overall pick in the 2018 NBA draft. He was the franchise's first No. 1 pick in their history. Never before had the player picked with the first overall selection gone to a team from the state where he played in high school and college before entering the NBA. Ayton joined the 2018 NBA Summer League Suns squad on July 1, 2018, signing his rookie-scale contract five days later. In his Summer League debut on July 6, Ayton recorded 10 points and 8 rebounds in a 92–85 win over the Dallas Mavericks. At the end of the event, Ayton averaged a double-double of 14.5 points and 10.5 rebounds in four games played and named a member of the All-Summer League Second Team. He also averaged 18.2 points, 9.8 rebounds, 2 blocks, 1.4 assists, and 0.8 steals per game in five games during the 2018 preseason with the Suns. Near the end of the preseason, he led all NBA players in points, rebounds, blocks, free-throws, and field goal attempts. Ayton made his NBA debut in the season opener on October 17, 2018 and earned a double-double with 18 points and 10 rebounds, as well as a season-high 6 assists, a steal, and a block with 36 minutes played as a starter in a 121–100 win over the Dallas Mavericks. It made Ayton the first player to record these stats in their debut game since Lew Alcindor in 1969, as well as the third player since Oscar Robertson in 1960. Five days later, Ayton recorded a double-double of 20 points and 14 rebounds (alongside 5 assists) in a 123–103 loss to the Golden State Warriors. On October 27, he recorded 24 points on near-perfect shooting (12/13 shots made) alongside 5 assists in a loss to the Memphis Grizzlies. He became the second rookie in 40 seasons (first being Adam Keefe) to score at least 12 shots with a 90% or higher field goal percentage. Six days later, Ayton recorded a double-double of 17 points and a season-high 18 rebounds in a 107–98 loss to the Toronto Raptors. Ayton later recorded a new career-high of 33 points, alongside 14 rebounds, in a 122–118 loss to the Denver Nuggets on December 29. Through the first half of the season, Ayton started in every game for the Suns when he was healthy, save for one. On January 29, 2019, Ayton was named a member of the World Team for the Rising Stars Challenge in the 2019 NBA All-Star Weekend. On March 27, Ayton broke Alvan Adams' rookie record for most double-doubles recorded by a rookie in franchise history. However, Ayton sprained his left ankle three days later against the Memphis Grizzlies, ending his rookie season early. He became the third rookie in a decade to average a double-double in their rookie season, joining Blake Griffin and Karl-Anthony Towns. At the conclusion of the season, Ayton was named as one of three finalists for the NBA Rookie of the Year Award in the 2019 NBA Awards show. On May 21, Ayton was selected to the 2019 All-Rookie First Team. On October 24, 2019, after the 2019–20 season opener, Ayton was suspended for 25 games after testing positive for a diuretic, violating the league's anti-drug policy. He returned from his suspension on December 17 against the Los Angeles Clippers, putting up 18 points and 12 rebounds in a 120–99 loss. Ayton was later immediately sidelined for the next five games due to a sprained right ankle before returning again, this time coming off the bench, on December 30 in a 122–116 win over the Portland Trail Blazers. He returned as a starter proper, albeit as a power forward, on January 3, 2020 in a 120–112 win over the New York Knicks. After a few more games, Ayton became the team's starting center again on January 16. That night, he scored 26 points and grabbed a career-high 21 rebounds in a 121–98 win over the Knicks. He became the first Suns player since Steve Nash to put up a 20/20 kind of game for the team (first player since Amar'e Stoudemire in terms of points and rebounds specifically), as well as the youngest player to have 25+ points and 20+ rebounds in the Madison Square Garden. On January 28, Ayton scored a season-high 31 points in a 133–104 win over the Dallas Mavericks. Two days later, Ayton was announced to return to the Rising Stars Challenge for the World Team; he joins only Amar'e Stoudemire and Devin Booker as announced participants in the event for the Suns as both a rookie and sophomore. On February 8, Ayton scored 28 points and grabbed 19 rebounds in a loss to the Denver Nuggets. He became the quickest player in franchise history to reach 1,000 rebounds at 94 games, as well as the fourth-quickest player to reach 1,000 since 1992. Ayton is known for being a physically demanding center at 7'1"", with a weight of 250 pounds being reported during his rookie season with Phoenix. His wingspan has been projected to be at 7'5"", while his vertical leap is slated to be at 43.5"". He sees his game as something akin to Hakeem Olajuwon's (primarily with his footwork, which allows him to keep up with smaller players) with the competitive mentality of Kevin Garnett. ESPN analyst Jay Williams compared him to David Robinson and Anthony Davis. Ayton represented The Bahamas in the 2016 Centrobasket, the regional basketball championship of FIBA Americas for the Central American and Caribbean subzone where he averaged a tournament-leading 11.1 rebounds per game. In June 2018, it was announced he would be sponsored by Puma after the German company announced that they would be returning to the basketball market. In the days after Hurricane Dorian struck the Bahamas, Ayton donated $100,000 to various relief efforts and held a relief drive on September 10, 2019 to collect further supplies and donations to give to those affected by the hurricane.",25391.0,2018-19,3078.0,1528.0,74429.0,315.9,723.1,24.945,71.6,230.9,16.337125645638675,244.3,492.4,27.861,160.9,198.7,45.85470478235409,99.2,292.5,392.0,204.0,65.8,34.0,121.5,200.1,864.6,Phoenix Suns

He has been named an NBA All-Star ten times and an All-NBA Team member six times. He played college basketball for the Syracuse Orange, winning a national championship as a freshman in 2003 while being named the NCAA Tournament's Most Outstanding Player. After one season at Syracuse, Anthony entered the 2003 NBA draft and was selected with the third overall pick by the Denver Nuggets. While playing for Denver, he led the Nuggets to the playoffs every year from 2004 to 2010; the team won two division titles in that span. In 2009, Anthony led the Nuggets to their first Conference Finals appearance since 1985. In 2011, he was traded from Denver to the New York Knicks days before the NBA trade deadline. In a January 24, 2014 game against the Charlotte Bobcats, Anthony scored a career-high 62 points, setting a Knicks' single-game scoring record and a Madison Square Garden single-game scoring record.Anthony was traded to the Oklahoma City Thunder, where he played one season before signing with the Rockets. Anthony has played in the Olympics for the US national team a record four times, winning a bronze medal with the 2004 squad and gold medals on the 2008, 2012, and 2016 Olympic teams. As of April 2016, he was the US Olympic team's all-time leader in points,rebounds, and games played.Anthony was born in the Red Hook housing projects in Brooklyn, New York City.His father, Carmelo Iriarte, was born in Manhattan to Puerto Rican parents. Iriarte was of African, Spanish, and indigenous ancestry; some of his roots also traced to Venezuela.His mother, Mary Anthony, is African-American. Iriarte died of cancer when Anthony was two years old. When Anthony turned eight, his family moved to Baltimore, where he honed not only his athletic skills, but his survival skills. Kenny Minor, one of Anthony's childhood friends, said, ""from drugs to killings, to anything you can name that goes on in the roughest parts of town, we've seen and witnessed hands on. Those are the things that teach you toughness and keep you mentally focused on your goals."" Sports would serve as an important diversion from the violence and drug dealing that were pervasive in the housing projects a few blocks from the homes of Anthony and his friends. Anthony commuted to Towson Catholic High School for his first three years of high school. During the summer of 1999, Anthony grew five inches into the frame of a 6–5 swingman. He suddenly became one of the area's top players and made a name for himself in the area, being named The Baltimore Sun's metro player of the year in 2001, as well as Baltimore Catholic League player of the year. During his sophomore year, he averaged 14 points, five rebounds, four assists and two steals. Towson Catholic surged to a record of 26–3 and finished third in the state tournament. Anthony enjoyed a successful high school basketball career as a junior, almost doubling his numbers in scoring and rebounds, averaging 23 points and 10.3 rebounds. Despite his successful year, Anthony was distracted by all of the attention and was suspended on several occasions for skipping classes. He barely registered a blip on the radars of pro scouts with his skinny frame and lack of strength; many scouts felt that he was not ready for the physical demands of the NBA. In the end, Towson Catholic fell short of the state title, although he was named Baltimore's County Player of the Year, All-Metropolitan Player of the Year and Baltimore Catholic League Player of the Year. After his junior year, Division I coaches were lined up to recruit Anthony to a school on the East Coast, which included North Carolina and Syracuse. In contrast to contemporary prep-to-pro players like Kevin Garnett, Jermaine O'Neal, Kobe Bryant, Tracy McGrady or Amar'e Stoudemire, he decided to declare early and announce that he would attend Syracuse University before his senior year. As Anthony's grades dropped under a C average and his scores on the ACT were below acceptable standards, he knew that he needed to improve in the classroom to qualify academically for Syracuse. For his senior year, his mother considered transferring him to a different school. Anthony first thought of Virginia's Hargrave Military Academy but after talking to Steve Smith, the head coach at basketball powerhouse Oak Hill Academy, he eventually transferred to Oak Hill Academy in Virginia—winner of the USA Today 2000–01 high school championship—for his senior campaign. During the summer of 2001, Anthony led an AAU Baltimore Select team to the Final Four of the Adidas Big Time Tournament in Las Vegas, Nevada. Anthony attracted attention from the NBA by averaging 25.2 points a game in the tournament, which was also attended by Amar'e Stoudemire (who was already being touted as a future lottery pick). Anthony played at the USA Basketball Youth Development Festival where he helped the East Team win the silver medal. He tied LeBron James for the tournament scoring lead at 24 points per game and shot 66 percent from the field. It was there that Anthony and James struck up a friendship. Oak Hill Academy entered the 2001–02 campaign boasting a 42-game winning streak. The team's first tournament win came in The Les Schwab Invitational against Mater Dei High School from Santa Ana, California, with Anthony winning the tournament MVP. Oak Hill won two more big-time tournaments, including the Nike Academy National Invitational where they knocked off then-No. 1 Westchester High School 77–61 in the final, and an anticipated game against St. Vincent – St. Mary High School of Akron, Ohio, where he was matched up with high school phenom LeBron James. James scored 36 points, while Anthony scored 34 points and grabbed 11 rebounds to lead Oak Hill to a 72–66 win. The team ended the season ranked third in the country at 32–1, with their only loss coming in a rematch against Mater Dei, which ended their unbeaten streak at 67. He averaged 21.7 points, 8.1 rebounds and 4.0 assists during his senior year at Oak Hill and named a USA Today All-USA First Team and a Parade First-Team All-American. He was selected to play in the Jordan Brand Classic, scoring a game-high 27 points, and the 2002 McDonald's All-American Game, where he played on the same team with two future New York Knicks teammates, Raymond Felton and Amar'e Stoudemire. In that game, he scored 19 points and won the Sprite Slam Jam dunk contest. His performances at the high school All-Star games, helped lift his reputation with HoopScoop ranking him as the nation's No. 1 high school senior in the class of 2002, ranked second by College Basketball News and third by All-Star Sports. Due to his struggles with the ACT, his family and friends wondered whether Anthony would forget about his college plans to attend Syracuse and move on to the NBA. He had yet to produce the minimum score of 18; however, in late April Anthony got a 19 and decided to stick with college and prepared for his freshman year at Syracuse. In April 2009, he was named to the ESPN RISE's all-decade team and was honored as one of the 35 Greatest McDonald's All-Americans in January 2012. Anthony played one season at Syracuse University, during the 2002–03 season, where he averaged 22.2 points (16th in the NCAA, fourth in the Big East) and 10.0 rebounds (19th in the NCAA, third in the Big East, first among NCAA Division I freshmen). He helped guide the Orangemen to their first ever NCAA tournament title in 2003. He led the team in scoring, rebounding, minutes played (36.4 minutes per game), field goals made and free throws made and attempted. Anthony's 33-point outburst against the University of Texas in the Final Four set an NCAA tournament record for most points by a freshman. In the championship game against the University of Kansas, Anthony had 20 points and 10 rebounds. For his efforts during the NCAA tournament, Anthony earned the tournament's Most Outstanding Player Award. Afterwards, Syracuse head coach Jim Boeheim described Anthony as by far, the best player in college basketball. It wasn't even close. Nobody was even close to him last year in college basketball. That's the bottom line"". Anthony said that he originally planned to stay at Syracuse for two to three seasons, but having already accomplished everything he set out to do, he chose to abandon his collegiate career (with Boeheim's blessing) and declared himself eligible for the 2003 NBA draft. Some of Anthony's highlights in his time with Syracuse include being named Second-Team All-American by the Associated Press as a freshman, leading his team to a 30–5 record, capturing the school's first ever NCAA title and being the consensus pick for NCAA Freshman of the Year. He was also named to the All-Big East First Team and was the consensus selection for the Big East Conference Freshman of the Year as so as unanimous selection for Big East All Rookie Team. Anthony's NBA career began on June 26, 2003, when he was chosen third overall in the 2003 NBA draft by the Denver Nuggets. He was selected behind LeBron James (first overall, Cleveland Cavaliers) and Darko Miličić (second overall, Detroit Pistons). He made his NBA regular season debut on October 29, 2003, in an 80–72 home win against the San Antonio Spurs. Anthony finished the night with 12 points, seven rebounds, and three assists. In just his sixth career NBA game (November 7 versus the Los Angeles Clippers), Anthony scored 30 points, becoming the second youngest player in NBA history to score 30 points or more in a game (19 years, 151 days; Kobe Bryant was the youngest). It was the fewest games a Nuggets rookie took to score 30 points in a contest since the ABA–NBA merger. On February 9, 2004, against the Memphis Grizzlies, Anthony became the third-youngest player to reach the 1,000-point plateau in NBA history with a 20-point effort in an 86–83 win. On February 13, 2004, Anthony participated in the Got Milk? Rookie Challenge at All-Star Weekend. On March 30, 2004, he scored 41 points against the Seattle SuperSonics to set a new Denver Nuggets franchise record for most points in a game by a rookie. He also became the second-youngest player (19 years, 305 days) to score at least 40 points in a game in NBA history. After winning the Rookie of the Month award for the Western Conference in the month of April, Anthony became the fourth player in NBA history to capture all six of the Rookie of the Month awards in a season. The others to do so were David Robinson, Tim Duncan and fellow rookie LeBron James. Anthony was also named NBA Player of the Week twice (March 10, 2004 – March 14, 2004, and April 6, 2004 – April 10, 2004) and was a unanimous NBA All-Rookie First Team selection. Anthony averaged 21.0 points per game during the season, which was more than any other rookie. Anthony was second in the NBA Rookie of the Year voting, finishing runner-up to the Cavaliers rookie standout, James. Anthony played a major part in the turnaround of the Denver Nuggets from league laughingstock to playoff contender. In the season before Anthony was drafted by the team, the Nuggets finished with a 17–65 record, which tied them for worst in the NBA with the Cleveland Cavaliers. They finished the 2003–04 campaign with a 43–39 overall record, qualifying them as the eighth seed for the playoffs. Anthony became the first NBA rookie to lead a playoff team in scoring since David Robinson of the San Antonio Spurs during the 1989–90 season. In the 2004 NBA Playoffs, the Nuggets faced the top-seeded Minnesota Timberwolves in the First Round. In Anthony's first career playoff game, he had 19 points, six rebounds, and three assists, in a 106–92 loss at Minnesota. The Timberwolves eliminated the Nuggets in five games. In Anthony's second season, he averaged 20.8 points per game, ranking him 19th in the NBA. Anthony placed 16th in the NBA for points per 48 minutes. On December 4, 2004, versus the Miami Heat, Anthony became the third-youngest player in NBA history to reach 2,000 career points. Only James and Bryant were younger when they reached that plateau. Anthony played again in the Got Milk? Rookie Challenge, this time suiting up for the sophomore squad. In front of his home fans of Denver (who were hosting the 2005 All-Star Game), Anthony scored a game-high 31 points to go along with five boards, two assists and two steals, en route to becoming the MVP of the game. With Anthony's help, the Nuggets improved their season record by six games from the previous season, ending with a mark of 49–33. The Nuggets finished seventh place in the Western Conference (one spot higher than they finished the previous season). Denver faced the second-seeded San Antonio Spurs in the First Round, winning the first game in San Antonio, 93–87. However, the eventual NBA champion Spurs won the next four games, eliminating the Nuggets from the playoffs. Anthony played and started in 80 games during the 2005–06 season. He averaged 26.5 points (eighth, NBA), 2.7 assists, 4.9 rebounds and 1.1 steals per game. His eighth-place finish in NBA scoring was the highest finish by a Denver player since the 1990–91 season, when Nuggets guard Michael Adams finished the season sixth in NBA scoring. On November 23, 2005, with the Nuggets facing the two-time defending Eastern Conference Champion Detroit Pistons, Anthony hauled down his 1,000th career rebound. A month later, Anthony recorded a then career-high 45 points in a losing effort against the Philadelphia 76ers. On March 17, 2006, versus the Memphis Grizzlies, he scored 33 points to push his career point total over the 5,000 mark. Also, in doing so, he became the second youngest player to accomplish that feat (behind LeBron James). As the month of March came to a close, the Nuggets finished 11–5, and Anthony was named as the NBA Player of the Month for March. He also took home Player of the Week honors for March 13, 2006 – March 19, 2006. During the season, Anthony made five game-winning shots in the last five seconds: at Houston on January 8, 2006; at home versus Phoenix on January 10; at Minnesota on February 24; at Indiana on March 15; at home versus the Los Angeles Lakers on April 6. All five of those game-winners were made on jump shots, while the shot against Minnesota was a three-point field goal. Anthony also made a shot in the final seconds to force overtime vs. the Dallas Mavericks on January 6. He made shots in the final 22 seconds against the Cleveland Cavaliers on January 18, 2006, and the Philadelphia 76ers on March 9, which gave the Nuggets leads they would never lose. Anthony was named to the All-NBA Third Team for the season, alongside Phoenix' Shawn Marion, Houston's Yao Ming, Philadelphia's Allen Iverson and Washington's Gilbert Arenas. The Nuggets finished the season in third place, winning the Northwest Division for the first time in Anthony's career. Denver faced the sixth-seeded Los Angeles Clippers in the First Round of the playoffs. The Clippers held home court advantage in the series, due to ending the regular season with a better record (Denver finished 44–38; Los Angeles finished 47–35). The Clippers won the first two games of the series on their home floor. The Nuggets split their games at home in Denver (winning game three; losing game four). Denver then lost game five at Los Angeles, which eliminated the Nuggets from the playoffs. After the season, Anthony signed a 5-year, $80 million extension with the Nuggets. In the eighth game of the season (a 117–109 home win against the Toronto Raptors), Anthony tied the franchise record of six-straight 30-point games recorded by Alex English (1982–83 season). Coincidentally, Alex English witnessed Anthony tie his record as English was an Assistant Coach at the time with the Toronto Raptors. Anthony fell short of establishing a new record in his ninth game (a 113–109 home victory over the Chicago Bulls) on November 21, as he finished with 29 points. After the Chicago victory, Anthony again tied the club record of six-straight 30-point games, failing to break it the second time around, as he scored 24 points in his 16th game (a 98–96 home loss to the Atlanta Hawks) on December 6. During a game at Madison Square Garden on December 16, Anthony was one of many players involved in the infamous Knicks–Nuggets brawl. Footage showed Anthony laying a punch on the face of New York's Mardy Collins and subsequently backing away. As a result of his actions, Anthony was suspended for 15 games by NBA commissioner David Stern. Shortly thereafter, the Nuggets traded for Allen Iverson in a bid to form a deadly combination with Anthony. The duo did not get to play alongside one another until a home game against the Memphis Grizzlies on January 22, which was the day Anthony was allowed to return from his 15-game suspension. Anthony finished the game with 28 points, as he and Iverson combined for 51 points. On February 2, 2007, Anthony and teammate J. R. Smith were involved in a minor car accident. Neither player was injured in the collision. The only information released by the team was that the car Smith was driving belonged to Anthony. Three days later, Anthony recorded his first career triple-double, with 31 points, 10 rebounds and 10 assists, in a 113–108 loss to the Phoenix Suns. When the reserves for the Western Conference All-Star team were announced, Anthony was not included on the roster. However, with Yao Ming and Carlos Boozer out with injuries, NBA commissioner David Stern chose Anthony as a replacement (along with Josh Howard). Anthony scored 20 points with nine rebounds in his All-Star debut. Anthony was the first Denver Nugget to be named an All-Star since Antonio McDyess in 2001. Anthony won Player of the Week honors three times during the season (November 20–26; November 27 – December 3; and February 5–11), and received Player of the Month honors for April, after leading the Nuggets to a 10–1 record for the month and into sixth place in the final regular season standings of the Western Conference. Anthony finished the season as the league's second leading scorer behind Bryant, with an average of 28.9 points, while adding 6.0 rebounds, 3.8 assists and 1.2 steals per game. He was named to All-NBA Third Team for the second straight year, along with Miami's Dwyane Wade, Detroit's Chauncy Billups, Minnesota's Kevin Garnett and Orlando's Dwight Howard. For the second time in three years, Anthony and the sixth-seeded Nuggets faced the third-seeded San Antonio Spurs in the First Round of the playoffs. In a virtual repeat of the 2005 First Round playoff matchup between the two teams, Denver won the first game in San Antonio, 95–89, only to lose the next four games to the eventual NBA champions. The Nuggets were eliminated in the First Round for the fourth straight year. In the playoff series against the Spurs, Anthony averaged a team-high 26.8 points to go along with 8.6 rebounds, 1.2 assists and 1.0 steals per game. On January 24, 2008, Anthony was named to his second consecutive NBA All-Star Game—his first as a starter. He finished as the leading vote-getter among Western Conference forwards (1,723,701 votes) and second in overall voting to Kobe Bryant (2,004,940 votes) among all Western Conference players. On February 8, Anthony scored a then career-high 49 points in a 111–100 home win over the Washington Wizards. He had a field goal percentage of .760 on a 19-of-25 shooting effort, and his shooting percentage was the second highest in the last 13 years for a player who took 25 or more shots in a game (Bryant was first with a .769 field goal percentage on a 20-of-26 shooting effort, in a 99–94 road victory over the Houston Rockets on December 21, 2000). On March 27, in a home win over the Dallas Mavericks, Anthony scored his 9,000th career point. He played in 77 games during the regular season, finishing as the NBA's fourth-leading scorer with 25.7 points per game, and had career-highs in rebounds per game (7.4) and steals per game (1.3). He tied his career-high in blocks per game (0.5), and ended the season with 3.4 assists per game, which was the second-best mark of his career. The Nuggets finished the 2007–08 season with exactly 50 wins (50–32 overall record, tied for the third-best all-time Nuggets record since the team officially joined the NBA in 1976), following a 120–111 home victory over the Memphis Grizzlies in the last game of the season. It was the first time since the 1987–88 NBA season that the Nuggets finished with at least 50 wins in a season. Denver ended up as the eighth seed in the Western Conference of the 2008 Playoffs, and their 50 wins marked the highest win total for an eighth seed in NBA history. It also meant that for the first time in NBA history, all eight playoff seeds in a conference had at least 50 wins. The Nuggets faced the top-seeded Los Angeles Lakers (57–25 overall record) in the First Round of the Playoffs. The seven games separating the Nuggets overall record and the Lakers overall record is the closest margin between an eighth seed and a top seed since the NBA went to a 16-team playoff format in 1983–84. The Lakers swept the Nuggets in four games, marking the second time in NBA history that a 50-win team was swept in a best-of-seven playoff series in the First Round. For the series, Anthony averaged 22.5 points, 9.5 rebounds (playoff career-high), 2.0 assists and 0.5 steals per game. The 2008–09 campaign began with Allen Iverson being traded to the Detroit Pistons in exchange for guard Chauncey Billups. On December 10, 2008, in a 116–105 home win over the Timberwolves, Anthony tied George Gervin for the most points scored in one quarter in NBA history by scoring 33 points in the third quarter. Gervin had set the record when he was competing against David Thompson for the scoring title on the last day of the 1977–78 season. Anthony shot 12 of 15 (80%) in the third quarter and finished the game with 45 points, 11 rebounds, three assists, and four steals. The record was broken in January 2015 by Klay Thompson of the Golden State Warriors. On January 4, 2009, Anthony broke a bone in his hand in a game against the Indiana Pacers. He opted to have the hand splinted rather than have surgery; his recovery time was estimated at three to four weeks. He had already missed three games in late December with a sore elbow. Anthony returned from injury and to the Nuggets starting lineup on January 30, 2009, in a game against the Charlotte Bobcats in which he scored 19 points. Anthony was suspended for one game by the Nuggets for staying on the court and refusing to leave the game after coach George Karl benched him during a game against the Pacers. The Nuggets won the Northwest Division and placed second in the Western Conference, finishing the season with a franchise record-tying 54 wins (54–28 overall). Anthony averaged 22.8 points per game and made a career-high 37.1% of his shots from three-point range. After losing in five straight playoff appearances (2004–2008), on April 29, 2009, Anthony won his first playoff series when the Nuggets beat the New Orleans Hornets at home 107–86 where Anthony finished with a playoff career-high 34 points and four steals. In a post-game conference, Anthony said ""Yeah, finally... Took me 5 years to get that gorilla off my back, it's a great feeling."" The Nuggets beat the Hornets in five games in the First Round of the playoffs and proceeded to beat the Dallas Mavericks 4–1 in the Conference Semifinals with Anthony scoring 30 points in a solid game five performance. In the third game of the semifinals, Anthony made a last second three-point shot to give the Nuggets the win after being down by two points (103–105). Denver advanced to the Conference Finals for the first time since 1985 but was eliminated, 4–2, by the eventual NBA champion Los Angeles Lakers on his birthday. In the opening two games of the 2009–10 season, Anthony totaled 71 points, scoring 30 points in the home opener and 41 the next night, in wins against division rivals Utah Jazz and Portland Trail Blazers respectively. Anthony became one of three players in the Nuggets' history to open with 70 or more points through two games—tied with Nick Van Exel with 71 points—surpassed only by Alex English who did it twice, in 1985 (79) and 1988 (74). It was also only the second time since 1987 that the Nuggets started the season 2–0. In their third game, Anthony scored 42 points, a game after his 41-point explosion against the Blazers, becoming the first Nugget to have scored back-to-back 40-point games since Michael Adams did it in 1991. It was the first time they went 3–0 since 1985. In the month of November, Anthony was named the NBA player of the week and Western Conference Player of the Month, leading the Nuggets to a 12–5 start. In the fifteenth regular season game against the Minnesota Timberwolves, Anthony entered the game leading the league in points per game (30.2) and was the only player in the league to score at least 20 points in every game. He finished the game with 22 points which was his fifteenth consecutive game with at least 20 points breaking the previous franchise record of 14 straight sets by English. The following game, Anthony scored a career-high 50 points in a home game against the New York Knicks while teammate Chauncey Billups added 32 points in the game, making them only the third duo in NBA history to score at least 50 and 30 points respectively. Two days later, Anthony scored 19 points in the first quarter—tying a season-high he made in the fourth quarter against the Portland Trail Blazers on October 29—in a home loss to the Timberwolves, 106–100, on the way to a total of 32 points. On January 21, 2010, Anthony was named as a starter for the 2010 NBA All-Star Game leading the Western Conference ballots in votes for forwards. This was Anthony's third All-Star appearance and second as a starter. He finished the game with a team-high 27 points and 10 rebounds, in a losing effort as the team bowed to the Eastern Conference team. In the team's first game after the All-Star Game, the Nuggets visited the Cleveland Cavaliers in a highly anticipated game with the Cavaliers having a 13-game winning streak. While LeBron James posted a triple-double of 43 points, 13 rebounds and 15 assists, Anthony compiled 40 points, six rebounds and seven assists in an overtime win as Anthony nailed a jumper over the outstretched arms of James with just 1.9 seconds left in the game, ending the Cavaliers' win streak. On March 26, 2010, Anthony made a game-winning shot at the buzzer, after missing his first attempt, against the Toronto Raptors. The Nuggets concluded the 2009–10 regular season with a 53–29 record and the Northwest Division title for the second straight season facing the Utah Jazz in the First Round. In Game 1, Anthony scored a playoff-career-high 42 points. This also matched a franchise-playoff high for scoring in a single playoff game, tied with Alex English. However, the Nuggets lost the series to the Utah Jazz 4–2, with Anthony averaging a playoff career-high 30.7 points per game, along with 8.5 rebounds, 3.2 assists and 2.0 steals. The 2010–11 season began with speculation that Anthony had requested a trade. Anthony refused to sign a proposed contract extension. Sources reported that Anthony's preferred destination was the New York Knicks, with other teams such as the New Jersey Nets, Houston Rockets and Atlanta Hawks said to be interested.[unreliable source?] Anthony's trade request was not initially fulfilled, and he began the season on the Nuggets' roster. On November 15, 2010, Anthony had 20 points and a career-high 22 rebounds for the first 20–20 game of his career against the Phoenix Suns. He also hit game-winning jumper at the buzzer against the Bulls on November 26, 2010. On February 22, 2011, Anthony, along with point guard Chauncey Billups, was traded to the New York Knicks in a multi-player deal also involving the Minnesota Timberwolves. Anthony chose to wear number 7 with the Knicks, as his former number 15 was retired by the Knicks in honor of Earl Monroe and Dick McGuire. Anthony's first game with the Knicks was a 114–108 win against the Milwaukee Bucks in which he scored 27 points and had 10 rebounds and an assist. After Anthony's acquisition, the Knicks qualified for the playoffs as the sixth seed in the Eastern Conference and were matched up against the Boston Celtics. During the series, the Knicks struggled with injuries as Amar'e Stoudemire and Billups went down. In game two of the NBA playoffs in Boston, Anthony tied a playoff career high with 42 points and also had 17 rebounds and six assists in a Knicks loss. The Knicks fell to the Boston Celtics in four games in the First Round of the playoffs. The 2011–12 season brought new expectations, as the season would be Anthony's first full season as a Knick. The Knicks struggled throughout the season, as injuries derailed the team. Anthony himself missed 11 games; during this stretch, the Knicks inserted Jeremy Lin as the team's starting point guard. This led to a historic stretch of games by Lin, and a period of basketball hysteria known as Linsanity. However, the team found themselves with an 18–24 record, leading to the resignation of coach Mike D'Antoni. Anthony was assumed to have a role in the coach's departure, as he was not a good fit in D'Antoni's high paced offense. Mike Woodson took over for D'Antoni; this led to an improvement in Anthony's play, as he was more suited for Woodson's halfcourt offense. On Easter Sunday, Anthony had arguably his best game in a Knicks uniform as he scored 43 points and hit two clutch three-pointers in a victory over Chicago. Under Woodson, the Knicks finished the season at 18–6, a vast improvement from the 18–24 record they had under D'Antoni. The Knicks qualified for the playoffs as the seventh seed in the Eastern Conference, and faced off against the eventual champions, the Miami Heat. During the series, the Knicks were hampered by injuries as they were a season before. Tyson Chandler was diagnosed with the flu for game 1, Iman Shumpert tore his ACL, Baron Davis tore his patella tendon, and All-Star Amar'e Stoudemire suffered a laceration on his hand after punching a fire extinguisher out of anger after a loss. In addition, Jeremy Lin had torn his left meniscus before the playoffs started. Despite the injuries, Anthony was able to lead the Knicks to their first playoff win since 2001. In the game, Anthony scored 41 points. The Knicks were eventually eliminated in five games, 4–1. Anthony was voted to the All-NBA Third Team alongside teammate Tyson Chandler. On December 3, 2012, Anthony was named Eastern Conference Player of the Week for the period November 26 to December 2, 2012. For the said period, Anthony led the Knicks to a 3–1 mark, averaging a league-best 29.5 points, 8.0 rebounds, and 1.3 blocks. Anthony scored over 30 points in two contests. In New York's 106–99 home victory over the Phoenix Suns on Dec 2, Anthony scored a game-high 34 points and added six rebounds, two assists, two blocks and a steal. On January 7, 2013, Anthony received his second Player of the Week citation for games played from December 31, 2012, to January 6, 2013. During that time, he led the team to a 2–1 record, tallying a league-best 36.0 points per game. The week was highlighted by a pair of 40-point games, first in a loss to Portland (45 points, seven rebounds, four assists) on January 1, and then in a victory over Orlando (40 points, six rebounds and six assists) on January 5. On January 9, 2013, Anthony was suspended for one game without pay for confronting Kevin Garnett after a game on January 7. On January 30, 2013, in a game against the Orlando Magic, Anthony set the Knicks' team-record with 30 straight 20-point games, breaking the old record set by Richie Guerin (29 games). Anthony later extended the record to 31 games after he scored 25 points in a 96–86 victory against the Milwaukee Bucks. On March 29, 2013, Anthony recorded 32 points and 11 rebounds in a 111–102 victory over the Charlotte Bobcats. His teammate J. R. Smith scored 37 points in the game. On March 31, 2013, Anthony scored 24 points and grabbed 10 rebounds in a win against the Boston Celtics as he recorded a double-double in consecutive games. With the victory, the Knicks won the season series against the Celtics (3–1) for the first time since the 2003–04 season. On April 2, 2013, Anthony tied his career high by scoring 50 points in a 102–90 win over the Miami Heat and became the first player in NBA history to record 50+ points with no baskets in the paint. He followed the next night with 40 points in a 95–82 victory over the Atlanta Hawks, and then 41 points against the Milwaukee Bucks two days later, becoming the first Knicks player since Bernard King to score 40+ points in three consecutive games. He also became only the third NBA player to score at least 40 points on at least 60% field-goal shooting in three consecutive games, joining King and Michael Jordan. On April 7, 2013, Anthony scored 36 points and 12 rebounds, nine offensive, as the Knicks tallied their 12th straight win in a 125–120 victory over the Oklahoma City Thunder. It was the team's 50th win of the season, and it marked the first time they posted that many wins in 13 years. By scoring 36 points to Kevin Durant's 27 points, he overtook the latter in the scoring race, upping his season average to 28.44 to Durant's 28.35 points per game. On April 8, 2013, Anthony was named Eastern Conference Player of the Week for the period April 1–7, 2013. He led the Knicks to a 4–0 record as part of their 12-game winning streak, during which he averaged 41.8 points per game. On April 9, 2013, Anthony kept up his torrid pace as he once again scored 36 points on a 13-of-21 shooting (3–4 from the three-point line) as he became the first Knick since King to post five consecutive games of at least 35 points in a 120–99 victory over the Washington Wizards. It was also the team's 51st win, and 13th straight win and they clinched their first Atlantic Division title since the 1993–94 season. No NBA player had scored at least 35 points in five straight games since Kobe Bryant in the 2006–07 season. In 2013, Anthony became the first Knicks player with the highest-selling jersey in the NBA, based on sales at the NBA Store and NBAstore.com, since the league started tracking jersey sales in 2001. On April 11, 2013, the Knicks' 13-game winning streak ended with a loss to the Bulls, 118–111. Despite the loss, Anthony scored 36 points on top of a season-high 19 rebounds, and he set a franchise record with six straight games with at least 35 points. The following day, the Knicks bounced back with an easy 101–91 victory over the struggling Cleveland Cavaliers. Anthony again led the way with another double-double game of 31 points and 14 rebounds in just under 30 minutes, as he sat out the entire fourth quarter for the second time in three games. On April 15, 2013, Anthony won his second straight Eastern Conference Player of the Week award for games played from April 8 to 15, 2013, when he led the team to a 3–1 record. For the week, he averaged a conference-best 32.0 points and a seventh-best 11.5 rebounds per game. He became the 2013 NBA scoring champion with 28.7 points per game after second place scorer and three-time reigning scoring champion Kevin Durant decided to sit out his last regular season game against the Milwaukee Bucks, ending his season with an average of 28.1 points per game. At the close of the regular season, Anthony was named as the Eastern Conference Player of the Month for April. Anthony broke LeBron James' stranglehold on the monthly award after James had received such honors five times that season. In the 2013 NBA Playoffs, Anthony scored 21 points to go with seven rebounds, five assists, two steals and one block in the Knicks' series-clinching 88–80 game six victory against the Boston Celtics, in their First Round playoff series. It was the Knicks' first playoff series win since 2000 (during the time of Patrick Ewing and Latrell Sprewell). Anthony averaged a team-high 29.2 points per game in the series. This was the second highest playoff series average of a Knick player against the Celtics, behind Ewing's 31.6 during their 1989–90 First Round series. In the next round, the Knicks were defeated by the Indiana Pacers in six games. On May 23, 2013, Anthony was named to the All-NBA Second Team, alongside Oklahoma City's Russell Westbrook, San Antonio's Tony Parker, the LA Clippers' Blake Griffin and Memphis' Marc Gasol. It was the second time in Anthony's career that he made the Second Team. Early in the 2013–14 NBA season, the Knicks suffered a nine-game losing streak, as the team opened with a 3–13 record. Despite the losing record, Anthony continued to play well under the circumstances, averaging 26.3 points, 9.9 rebounds and 1.1 steals per game, nine double-doubles including four straight: against Indiana (30 points and 18 rebounds), Washington (23 and 12), Portland (34 and 15) and LA Clippers (27 and 10). However, at the start of 2014, the Knicks went 4–1, including big wins against previous season finalists Miami Heat and San Antonio Spurs. In the victory against the Heat, Anthony and James ended up in a virtual deadlock as the former registered 29 points (shooting 12-of-24), eight rebounds, five assists and two steals as against the latter's 32 points (shooting 12-of-17), five rebounds, six assists, one steal and one block. On January 13, 2014, Anthony was named the Eastern Conference Player of the Week for games played January 6–12, 2014 where he led the Knicks to a 3–0 record. He beat out Brooklyn's Joe Johnson and Detroit's Josh Smith for the honor. On January 24, he established his career high, the Knicks' franchise record, and the Madison Square Garden record for single-game scoring with a 62-point, 13-rebound, 0 turnover effort against the Charlotte Bobcats. On January 30, 2014, in a 117–86 victory against the Cleveland Cavaliers, Anthony became the 50th NBA player to score 19,000 career points. In doing so at the age of 29 years and 246 days old, Anthony became the fifth-youngest NBA player to achieve the feat, only beaten by LeBron James (27 years and 111 days), Kobe Bryant (28 and 223), Michael Jordan (29 and 62) and Wilt Chamberlain (29 and 75). On February 5, 2014, Anthony was named Eastern Conference Player of the Month for the month of January. Anthony led the Eastern Conference in scoring with a 28.7 points, ninth in rebounding with 9.0 rebounds and third in minutes played with a 37.7 minutes per game, while leading the Knicks to a 10–6 record highlighted by his 62-point game effort against Charlotte. On February 16, 2014, Anthony played in his seventh All-Star Game as a starter for the East All-Stars. He scored 30 points and set an NBA All-Star game record of eight made three-pointers, breaking the old mark of six jointly shared by Mark Price and LeBron James. On March 10, 2014, Anthony won his second Eastern Conference Player of the Week citation for games played March 3–9, 2014. During the week, Anthony led the Knicks to a 3–1 record with averages of 29.0 points (third-best in the Eastern Conference), 5.3 rebounds, 4.8 assists and 2.75 steals (fifth-best) per game, while playing a conference fourth-best 38.7 minutes per game. For the 2013–14 season, Anthony averaged 27.4 points, 8.1 rebounds, and 3.1 assists in a league-leading 38.7 minutes per game, but would miss the NBA playoffs for the first time in his career. On June 23, 2014, Anthony informed the Knicks that he would opt out of his contact and become a free agent. On July 13, 2014, Anthony re-signed with the Knicks to a reported five-year deal. In just the team's third game in the season, Anthony became the 40th member of the exclusive 20,000 points club, when he hit a three-pointer early in the first quarter of a 96–93 victory over the Charlotte Hornets. He eventually finished with 28 points, hiking his total to 20,025 career points. In the process, he became the 10th active player to achieve the milestone and the sixth youngest in NBA history to reach the milestone just behind LeBron James (28 years, 17 days), Kobe Bryant (29 years, 122 days), Wilt Chamberlain (29 years, 134 days), Michael Jordan (29 years, 326 days) and Oscar Robertson (30 years, 97 days). Anthony accomplished this at the age of 30 years and 157 days and in a total of 793 NBA games, tied for 15th all-time in number of games needed to score at least 20,000 points. On January 22, 2015, Anthony was named as a starter in the 2015 NBA All-Star Game, his seventh consecutive start and eight overall alongside LeBron James, Pau Gasol, Kyle Lowry and John Wall. After competing in the All-Star game and scoring 10 points, Anthony was ruled out for the rest of the season on February 18, after undergoing left knee surgery. On January 20, 2016, in the Knicks' 118–111 overtime win against the Jazz, Anthony recorded 30 points, seven rebounds and nine assists, while passing Larry Bird for 31st place in career points scored. On January 21, Anthony was voted as starter for the 2016 NBA All-Star Game. In the All-Star game Anthony recorded 11 points, 6 rebounds and 1 block in the East's 196–173 loss to the West. On January 23, Anthony moved past Gary Payton as the league's 30th all-time career scoring leader in a 97–84 loss to the Charlotte Hornets On December 9, 2016, in a game against the Sacramento Kings, Anthony became the fifth active player to eclipse the 23,000 point mark joining Dirk Nowitzki, James, Paul Pierce and Vince Carter in the prestigious club. He also became the 29th player in NBA history to hit the scoring milestone. On December 25, 2016, in a Christmas Day game against the Boston Celtics, Anthony moved past Elgin Baylor into 28th place on the NBA career scoring list when he scored 29 points upping his total to 23,156 compared to Baylor's 23,149. On December 30, 2016, Anthony scored 26 points against the New Orleans Pelicans in a 92–104 loss, upping his total to 23,192 points, moving past Adrian Dantley into 27th place in the NBA career scoring list. After their game against the Houston Rockets on December 31, 2016, where he scored only seven points, after sitting out the second half of the game due to a sore left knee, he had a total of 23,199 points. In a January 11, 2017, game against the Philadelphia 76ers, which the team lost 98–97 on a buzzer-beater, Anthony scored 28 points to move past Robert Parish into 26th place in the NBA career scoring ladder. On January 19, 2017, Anthony scored a Knicks-record 25 points in the second quarter, breaking the old record of 24 points shared by Hall of Famer Willis Reed and Allan Houston. Reed scored his 24 points also in the second quarter, while Houston's 24 points came in the fourth quarter. On January 29, 2017, Anthony scored a season-high 45 points, his first 40-point game of the season, in a quadruple-overtime 142–139 loss to the Atlanta Hawks won. He added six rebounds, four assists and a block in one of his better all-around games of the season. He scored the game-tying baskets in the regulation and first OT period before he fouled out with 12.9 seconds left in the second OT. In the February 12, 2017, game against the San Antonio Spurs, where the team eked out a 94–90 victory that salvaged the finale of their five-game homestand, Anthony scored a game-high 25 points to move past Charles Barkley into 25th position in the NBA career scoring list. He also had the fifth-most points among active players after Nowitzki, James, Pierce, and Carter, who was No. 24 in the scoring list. It was the 12th time Anthony has scored at least 17 points in his last 13 games that included his season-high of 45 points in a quadruple-OT loss to the Atlanta Hawks. On February 15, 2017, he was announced as the replacement for Kevin Love on the 2017 NBA All-Star Game, thus gaining his tenth All-Star appearance. Anthony played 19 minutes, scored 10 points on a 4-of-8 shooting including 2–6 on three-pointers and grabbed three rebounds in the All-Star Game. On March 12, 2017, in a 120–112 loss to Knicks cross-town rivals Brooklyn Nets, Anthony became only the third player to score 10,000 points for two franchises, joining Kareem Abdul-Jabbar (Milwaukee Bucks and L.A. Lakers) and Elvin Hayes (San Diego/Houston Rockets and Baltimore/Capital/Washington Bullets). He began his career with the Denver Nuggets, where he scored a total of 13,970 points in 564 games. Two days later, on March 14, in an 87–81 victory over the Indiana Pacers, ending a three-game losing streak, Anthony surpassed the 24,000 career point mark by scoring 22 points with 13 rebounds. During the 2017 off-season, after multiple conflicts with the then-team president Phil Jackson, Anthony demanded a trade. Originally, the only team for which Anthony was willing to waive his no-trade clause was the Houston Rockets. However, Anthony expanded his list of teams to include the Cleveland Cavaliers and the Oklahoma City Thunder. On September 25, 2017, Anthony was traded to the Thunder in exchange for Enes Kanter, Doug McDermott and a 2018 second-round pick. During Anthony's seven seasons with the Knicks, the team won one playoff series. On November 9, 2017, with only 12 points needed to move up in the rankings, Anthony passed Allen Iverson on the NBA all-time scoring list and moved to the 24th spot. He finished the game with 28 points. On November 26, 2017, Anthony passed Ray Allen on the NBA all-time scoring list and moved to 23rd place. On December 11, 2017, Anthony passed Vince Carter for 22nd on the NBA all-time scoring list. On January 4, 2018, in Oklahoma City's game against the Los Angeles Clippers as part of their LA back-to-back (on January 3 they beat the LA Lakers 133–96), Anthony scored 22 points, moving past Patrick Ewing into 21st place on the NBA all-time scoring list. On January 27, 2018, Anthony became the 21st NBA player to score 25,000 career points. In addition, he has 1,693 playoff points. On March 6, 2018, in Oklahoma City's game against the Houston Rockets, Anthony scored 23 points to move past NBA legend Jerry West into the Top 20 in the NBA career scoring list as he now has a total of 25,210 as compared to West's 25,192 total points. On March 19, 2018, in a 132–125 victory over the Toronto Raptors, Anthony scored 15 points to up his career total to 25,289, thereby moving past Reggie Miller into 19th place in the NBA career scoring ladder. On July 25, 2018, the Thunder traded Anthony to the Atlanta Hawks in a three-team trade in which they acquired Dennis Schröder from the Hawks and Timothé Luwawu-Cabarrot from the Philadelphia 76ers. The trade was widely seen as a cost-cutting move, as it saved the Thunder tens of millions of dollars in luxury tax payments. On July 30, Anthony accepted a contract buyout from the Hawks, and was subsequently placed on waivers. On August 13, 2018, Anthony signed a one-year, $2.4 million veterans minimum contract with the Houston Rockets coached by his former Knicks coach, Mike D'Antoni. On November 15, Rockets general manager Daryl Morey announced that the team was ""parting ways"" with Anthony, but had not released him. He played ten games for Houston, starting twice, but he was held out of the last three for what the club called an unspecified ""illness."" During that absence, much of his playing time went to rookie Gary Clark. Houston had started the season losing seven of their first 11 games. Morey said that Anthony ""accepted every role"" asked by D'Antoni, but that the ""fit we envisioned when Carmelo chose to sign with the Rockets has not materialized; therefore we thought it was best to move on as any other outcome would have been unfair to him."" D'Antoni stated that he ""didn't ever want to disrespect [Anthony] and his career. He's going in the Hall of Fame."" On January 22, 2019, the Rockets traded Anthony, the draft rights to Jon Diebler, and undisclosed cash considerations to the Chicago Bulls in exchange for the draft rights to Tadija Dragićević. This trade allowed the Rockets to alleviate luxury-tax penalties up to $2.6 million. On February 1, he was waived by the Bulls. On November 19, 2019, Anthony was signed by the Portland Trail Blazers to a one-year, non-guaranteed deal. With his last NBA game having been on November 8, 2018, Anthony made his debut as a Blazer in a 115–104 road loss to the New Orleans Pelicans on November 19; he started and had 10 points to go along with 4 rebounds and 1 block in 24 minutes of play. On November 25, Anthony scored a season-high 25 points along with 8 rebounds in a 117–94 road victory over the Chicago Bulls. In the same game, Anthony moved past Alex English into 18th spot on the NBA's all-time scoring list. A couple of days later Anthony was named Western Conference Player of the Week when he led the Trail Blazers to a 3–0 record with averages of 22.7 points, 7.7 rebounds and 2.7 assists per game. On December 6, Anthony's contract became fully guaranteed. On January 1, 2020, Anthony bested his season-high by scoring 26 points in a 117–93 loss to the New York Knicks. On January 7, Anthony recorded a new season-high 28 points and seven rebounds, and hit the game-winning shot in a 101–99 win over the Toronto Raptors. On January 15, Anthony recorded his third double-double of the season with 18 points and a season-high 12 rebounds in Portland's 117–107 victory over the Rockets. On January 17, Anthony scored 22 points in a 120–112 loss to the Dallas Mavericks, while becoming the 18th player in NBA history to reach the 26,000 points mark. Anthony scored six points in the Trail Blazers' 125–112 win against the Rockets on January 29, and passed Kevin Garnett for 17th place in the NBA's all-time scoring list with a total of 26,073 points. Anthony was one of 12 players named to the USA Basketball Men's Junior National Team in the summer of 2002. He was a member of the bronze-medal winning Team USA at the 2002 fourth Junior World Championship Qualifying Tournament held in La Asunción, Margarita, Venezuela. He started all five contests and averaged a team-best 15.6 points per game despite playing an average of just 22.2 minutes an outing. His 6.2-rebound mark ranked second on the club behind Chris Bosh. He also averaged 1.8 assists, 1.2 steals and 0.2 blocks per game. Anthony had 15 points and nine rebounds in a first round win against the Dominican Republic. He had 21 points and seven boards in 21 minutes versus Mexico, another Team USA triumph. He keyed a 75–73 victory against Argentina with a team-leading 23 points. In a two-point semifinal loss to host Venezuela, Anthony contributed 13 points and 10 rebounds. Team USA earned the bronze by beating Argentina, 71–65. Oregon mentor Ernie Kent coached the squad. Anthony had previous USA Basketball experience as a participant in the 2001 Youth Development Festival. After his rookie season, Anthony, along with fellow 2003 draftees LeBron James and Dwyane Wade, was chosen as a member of the 2004 USA Olympic basketball team alongside veterans Allen Iverson, Stephon Marbury and Tim Duncan that won the bronze medal. He averaged 2.4 points, 1.6 rebounds and 6.8 minutes of playing time while playing in seven of the team's eight games. In 2006, Anthony was named co-captain (along with James and Wade) of Team USA at the 2006 FIBA World Championship. The team won the bronze medal. On August 23, 2006, Anthony set the U.S. scoring record in a game with 35 points against Italy in the said FIBA tournament. The record was previously held by Kenny Anderson with 34 points in 1990. Anthony was named to the FIBA World Championship All-Tournament Team, posting averages of 19.9 points (led team), 3.7 rebounds and 1.6 assists per game. On January 16, 2006, Anthony was chosen as the USA Basketball Male Athlete of the Year after his performance at the FIBA World Championship. Anthony was also a member of Team USA during the 2007 FIBA Americas Championship. The team went undefeated, going 10–0. Anthony ended up as the team's leading scorer and tournament's second-leading scorer with a 21.2-point average (191 points in nine games), which was behind Leandro Barbosa of Brazil. Anthony also added 5.2 rebounds, 1.4 assists, 0.7 steals and 0.3 blocks per game. He equaled the previous record of 28 points set by Allen Iverson in a qualifying tournament, which was later broken by James, who scored 31 points in the title-clinching win against Argentina. Anthony was also named to the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing, again alongside James and Wade, with Kobe Bryant and Jason Kidd among others. The team won its games by an average winning margin of 32.2 points, eliminating Australia in the quarterfinals by 31 and beating Argentina by 20 points. Anthony scored 21 points against Argentina, making 3-of-14 field goals and 13-of-13 in free throws, setting USA Olympic game records for made free throws and free throw percentage. In the gold medal game, the United States defeated 2006 World Champion Spain, with Anthony scoring 13 points. Anthony posted averages of 11.5 points, 4.3 rebounds and 1.0 steals per game in eight contests. Anthony, along with LeBron James, also participated in the 2012 Summer Olympics held in London. It was his third straight Olympiad (2004, 2008, 2012), as he joined James and David Robinson (1988, 1992, 1996) as the only American basketball players to play in three Olympiads. Anthony played in all eight games, serving as Team USA's sixth man. He posted averages of 16.3 points, 4.8 rebounds, 1.3 assists and 0.5 steals per game, built around 50% shooting from three-point range (23–46), 53% field-goal shooting (46–86) and 79% free throws (15–19). In a 156–73 victory over Nigeria, Anthony connected on 10–12 three-point attempts, both US Olympic records for made and attempted shots, on the way to 37 points, another Team USA record (breaking the 31 of Stephon Marbury set in the 2004 edition). Team USA won the gold medal as they defended their 2008 title against Spain, winning 107–100. Anthony's 16.3 points per game average were the second best for Team USA behind Kevin Durant's record-setting 19.5 points per game. Anthony's 23 made three-point shots were second-best to Durant's record 34 as they both broke the previous Team USA record of 17 made three-point shots. Anthony also played in the 2016 Olympic Games, his fourth straight stint in the Olympics, which was a record for a US male basketball player, breaking the old record of having played in three Olympiads he shared with James and Robinson. Team USA won the gold medal when they beat Serbia, 96–66, in the championship game with Anthony becoming the first player in US men's basketball history to win three gold medals. During the team's 98–88 victory over Australia, Anthony scored a game-high 31 points in 35 minutes built around 11–21 field goal shooting, including 9–15 from three-point range. By scoring 31 points in that game, he became Team USA's scoring leader, breaking the old record of 273 points held by James. He also became the first US player to score 30 or more points in two Olympic Games. In the gold medal game against Serbia, Anthony collared seven rebounds to finish with 125 total rebounds in US Olympic history, passing Robinson as Team USA's all-time leader in most rebounds. In summary, Anthony caps his Olympic career as the first man to win three gold medals, career leader in scoring, rebounding and games played, with 31, thereby becoming USA basketball's most decorated Olympian. He finished the 2016 Rio Olympics with averages of 12.1 points, 5.2 rebounds, 2.2 assists, 0.6 steals per game, built on 39% field goal shooting (33/84), 40% from three-point area (18/45) and 62% free throws (13/21). In recognition of his performances and accomplishments in the tournament, Anthony was named co-USA Basketball Male Athlete of the Year (along with Kevin Durant) for the third time in his career. Anthony plays the small forward position, but he is also capable of playing power forward. His scoring prowess is considered his best asset with his ability to take over any game on the offensive end; he shares the NBA record for second most points scored in one quarter with 33, and holds the New York Knicks single-game franchise scoring record with 62. On offense, Anthony is recognized for being a prolific scorer with a variety of crafty offensive moves. Listed at 6 ft 8 in (2.03 m) and 235 pounds (107 kg), he has strength and quickness to be an immediate and consistent scoring threat in the post. He also likes creating space from his defenders which allows him to step into his jump shot or put the ball on the floor and drive to the basket and get to the free throw line. Anthony is often known for being one of the premier clutch performers in the NBA; during the 2005–06 season, Anthony made five game-winning shots in the last five seconds of the fourth quarter or overtime.Dave McMenamin, a staff writer for ESPN, wrote, ""If you were going to choose one player to challenge Bryant for his title of Mr. Clutch, it would have to be Anthony."" Despite being a prolific scorer, he has been criticized for his defense and has never been named to the NBA All-Defensive Team. Anthony is one of many NBA players who use Idan Ravin as a personal coach and trainer. His relationship with Ravin started when he was 18 years old and preparing for the NBA draft after spending his one year at Syracuse University. Anthony has two brothers, Robert and Wilford, and a half-sister, Daphne. He had another sister, Michelle, who died in 2010. His mother, Mary, is African American and his father, Carmelo Iriarte, was Puerto Rican. In 2004, Anthony became engaged to Alani ""La La"" Vazquez. Their son, Kiyan Carmelo Anthony, was born on March 7, 2007. Michael Eric Dyson married Anthony and La La on July 10, 2010, at Cipriani's in New York City before 320 guests. VH1 filmed the ceremony for use in a reality series on the couple, titled La La's Full Court Wedding. Anthony resides on the Upper West Side. Shortly after the end of the 2016–17 regular season, TMZ reported that La La had moved out of the couple's apartment and the two were living separately. The two reconciled in December 2018. In 2004, Anthony was cited for marijuana possession, after inspectors at Denver International Airport found marijuana in his backpack. Charges were later dropped after Anthony's friend, James Cunningham, of St. Louis, signed an affidavit taking responsibility for the marijuana. That same year, Anthony appeared in a video entitled Stop Snitchin', which warned that residents of Baltimore who collaborated with the police would face violence. Anthony later distanced himself from this video. In 2006, Anthony's friend, Tyler Brandon Smith, was pulled over in Anthony's vehicle and cited for marijuana possession and three traffic violations. Later that year, he was involved in the infamous Knicks–Nuggets brawl during a game at Madison Square Garden. He was suspended for 15 games as a result. On April 14, 2008, Anthony was arrested on suspicion of driving under the influence, after being pulled over on Interstate 25 in Denver for weaving through lanes and not dimming his lights. Police spokesperson Detective Sharon Hahn said Anthony, who was alone in the car, failed a series of sobriety tests. He was ticketed and then released at police headquarters to a ""sober, responsible party."" A court date was set for May 14. The Nuggets suspended Anthony for two games due to the arrest. On June 24, 2008, Anthony pleaded guilty to a charge of driving while ability-impaired. The original charge of driving while under the influence was dropped. He was sentenced to one year of probation, 24 hours of community service and US$1,000 in court costs and fines. Anthony has recently advocated various social justice causes. He is also being criticized by South Bronx community activists for aligning himself with Mott Haven developer Keith Rubenstein's efforts to build luxury apartment buildings in the neighborhood, which could lead to gentrification. In Denver, Anthony was a spokesman for the Family Resource Center and helped organize a Christmas party, entitled ""A Very Melo Christmas,"" for less well-off children. In Baltimore, Anthony hosts an annual 3-on-3 tournament, known as ""Melo's H.O.O.D. (Holding Our Own Destiny) Movement 3 on 3 Challenge"" and is helping fund the revitalization of a local community center for local youth. Anthony opened ""The Carmelo Anthony Youth Development Center"" in Baltimore on December 14, 2006. He contributed $1.5 million to the Living Classrooms Foundation, a non-profit organization that ""provides innovative hands-on-education, job-training, and community service programs for over 35,000 children, youth and young adults in the east Baltimore community."" After the tsunami caused by the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake, Anthony donated $35,000 to relief efforts. He donated $1,000 per point scored against San Antonio and Houston on January 8 and 9, 2005, respectively.Anthony also committed $3 million toward the construction of a newly planned basketball practice facility at his alma mater, Syracuse University. According to the NBA's official website, ""Anthony's gift represents one of the largest individual donations to Syracuse University Athletics and is also believed to be one of largest by a current professional athlete to the school they attended."" The practice facility will be called the Carmelo K. Anthony Basketball Center. For charitable contributions totaling $4,282,000, Anthony was listed as number eight in ""The Giving Back 30 List of Largest Charitable Donations by Celebrities in 2006"". Anthony was a guest star in the ""Lost and Found"" episode of Ned's Declassified School Survival Guide. He also appeared in the music video for Common's song ""Be"" from the album Be in 2005. Anthony is the only player to appear on the cover of all three EA Sports basketball franchises (NCAA March Madness, NBA Live and NBA Street). In January 2009, Colorado Sports Hall of Fame selected Anthony as its professional athlete of the year for 2008. He and wrestler Henry Cejudo, also a 2008 gold medalist, were chosen to be the special award headliners for the induction banquet held on April 14, 2009. In spring 2012, Anthony guest starred in several episodes of the Showtime series Nurse Jackie as a professional baseball player going through drug rehab. He, along with Dwight Howard and Scottie Pippen, also appeared in the 2013 Chinese film Amazing, a joint venture between the NBA and Shanghai Film Group Corporation. In 2003, Anthony signed his first shoe deal with Jordan brand and was paid $3.5 million per year for six years. In 2004, his first signature shoe, the Jordan Carmelo 1.5, was released. As of 2018, thirteen shoes have been released in the Melo line. In 2014, Anthony made a brief cameo appearance in the eighth episode of the seventh and final season FX series Sons of Anarchy as a henchman to series antagonist Moses Cartwright. He also participated in a merchandising cooperation with Nickelodeon for the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles franchise, where he has several guest appearances, namely in the 2016 action film and as a comic character in the Amazing Adventures spin-off comics to the 2012 TV series. In 2015, Anthony founded North American Soccer League expansion club Puerto Rico FC. Despite the financial recession in Puerto Rico, Anthony saw this opportunity as a form of community outreach, as well as a long-term investment in a club that could ultimately be profitable. Anthony is also a fan of English football club Arsenal.",16521.0,2003-04,5544.0,3956.0,158821.0,651.7,1461.2,48.03928172627131,143.5,414.9,31.945251291277348,508.3,1047.0,52.52520805788816,321.4,436.2,79.12270478235409,196.0,575.3,772.5,295.1,129.2,87.2,242.2,401.3,1768.0,Portland Trail Blazers

In 2016, he transferred to Sierra Canyon School in Chatsworth, California.He was ruled ineligible to play his first year at Sierra Canyon due to California Interscholastic Federation (CIF) rules.That ruling would help play a factor into reclassifying his senior year of high school up a year early. In his last season for Sierra Canyon, he averaged 24.9 points per game and 10.1 rebounds per game. He would be named for the All-USA Today First-team in 2017.

Bagley was ranked the No.1 overall recruit and No.1 power forward in the 2017 high school class. His first college basketball scholarship came from Northern Arizona University when he was 14. Before beginning what would have been his senior year of high school, Bagley reclassified into the Class of 2017. On August 14, 2017, he announced that he successfully reclassified as a graduate from Sierra Canyon and was eligible to play college basketball for Duke University during the 2017–18 NCAA Division I men's basketball season. thus allowing him to enter the 2018 NBA draft as an early entry in the collegiate level.

He tied the freshman record for rebounds in the next game 4 days later and scored 30 points in an 87–84 win over the Florida Gators. It was the first time a Duke player did so since the 1960s. On December 30, Bagley recorded 32 points and a record 21 rebounds in a 100–93 win over the Florida State Seminoles. With 30 points and 11 rebounds in an 89–71 win over the Wake Forest Demon Deacons on January 13, 2018, he became the ACC's record holder for most 30 point, 10 rebound double-doubles in a season. At the end of the regular season, Bagley was named both the ACC's Rookie of the Year and Player of the Year, as well as a member of the All-ACC first team. He was also named a consensus member of the All-American First-Team by multiple organizations. In addition to that, Bagley joined Deandre Ayton and Trae Young as the most freshmen players to join the consensus All-American First-Team in a season. Following Duke's loss in the 2018 NCAA Men's Basketball Tournament, Bagley announced his intention to forgo his final three seasons of collegiate eligibility and declare for the 2018 NBA draft. On June 21, 2018, Bagley was selected second overall in the 2018 NBA draft by the Sacramento Kings, behind his former high school teammate Deandre Ayton. On July 1, 2018, he signed a rookie scale contract with the Kings. Bagley made his professional debut with Sacramento on October 17, 2018, with 6 points and 5 rebounds in only 12 minutes coming off the bench in a 123–117 loss to the Utah Jazz. In his next game two days later, Bagley recorded 19 points, 8 rebounds, 3 assists, and 3 blocks in a 149–129 loss to the New Orleans Pelicans. On November 24, Bagley had a double-double of 20 points and 17 rebounds coming off the bench in a 117–116 loss to the Golden State Warriors.

The power forward played college basketball for two seasons with the Texas Longhorns. Aldridge was selected second overall in the 2006 NBA draft. After spending nine seasons with the Portland Trail Blazers, he signed with the Spurs in 2015. He has been selected to five All-NBA teams and is a seven-time NBA All-Star. He is widely known for his signature fadeaway jump shot.Aldridge attended Seagoville High School, where he became a second-team Parade All-American and Texas Association of Basketball Coaches (TABC) Class 4A Player of the Year. Considered a five-star recruit by Rivals.com, Aldridge was listed as the No. 4 best center and the No. 16 player in the nation in 2004.Aldridge attended the University of Texas at Austin.He declared for the 2004 NBA draft but ultimately withdrew his name.According to one report, Aldridge's initial decision to attend college rather than entering the pro ranks directly from high school was influenced by Shaquille O'Neal's personal advice that he should go to college and then evaluate his NBA prospects.However, in April 2006, after the end of his second year with the Longhorns, Aldridge announced that he would leave college to enter the 2006 NBA draft.Aldridge was drafted second overall in the 2006 NBA draft by the Chicago Bulls, only to have his rights traded to the Portland Trail Blazers for their pick, Tyrus Thomas, and Viktor Khryapa, shortly after. The Bulls acquired the pick from the New York Knicks in the 2005 Eddy Curry trade. Aldridge missed the first seven games of the 2006–07 NBA season due to off-season shoulder surgery, but returned ahead of schedule due in part to an injury to fellow rookie teammate Brandon Roy. Aldridge made an immediate impact on offense, averaging 8.4 points on 54% shooting from the field through his first 14 games. After the loss of starting center Joel Przybilla, in February 2007 to season-ending knee surgery, Aldridge was awarded the starting center position and improved his scoring to 14.7 points with 8.0 rebounds per game in the month of March. This placed him second in the voting for the Western Conference Rookie of the Month to Roy. On March 31, 2007, in the first quarter against the Los Angeles Clippers, Aldridge was taken to Providence Hospital in Portland for shortness of breath and irregular heartbeat. He was diagnosed with Wolff–Parkinson–White syndrome on April 9 and missed the remaining eight games of the 2006–07 season.Aldridge started 22 games his rookie season.Aldridge was one of six players named to the 2007 NBA All-Rookie first team; he tied for fifth place with Toronto Raptors player Jorge Garbajosa. Aldridge elevated his play in his second season, with career highs in points, rebounds, assists, blocks and steals, and finished third in voting for the NBA Most Improved Player Award. During this season, Aldridge had injury troubles due to plantar fasciitis, which caused him to miss games from December 11 to 18, 2007. After the time missed, Aldridge still had some trouble with the foot but was able to play effectively. Aldridge played inconsistently to start the season, adjusting to more defensive pressure. He called the first 15 games ""the worst funk"" of his life but gradually improved as the season went on. Aldridge developed his offensive game over the course of the season, still relying heavily on his midrange fade away shot. He finished the season averaging 18.1 points and 7.5 rebounds. Aldridge scored over 20 points in half of the last 28 games of the season. For his first time in the league Aldridge nearly played a full season, missing only one game. In late October, Aldridge signed a five-year, $65 million contract extension with Portland. Before committing to Aldridge, the Trail Blazers finalized a five-year, $80 million deal with All-Star Brandon Roy. Aldridge put up similar numbers to the previous season. Early in December, Greg Oden suffered a season-ending injury. Aldridge received more minutes and offensive opportunities as a result. Aldridge further emerged as both a player and a leader after Brandon Roy went out with knee problems in December 2010. In spite of Portland's ""send LA to LA"" program – the NBA All-Star game was in Los Angeles and Aldridge's nickname is ""L-A"" – Aldridge failed to get named to the Western Conference squad. He was, however, awarded the NBA Player of the Week for January 17–23 and February 7–13, and scored a career-high 42 points against the Chicago Bulls on February 7, 2011. On March 2, he joined Clyde Drexler (1991) and Kelvin Ransey (1981) as the only Blazers to ever receive the NBA Player of the Month award. Aldridge was runner-up to Kevin Love for the Most Improved Player Award, and voted to the All-NBA Third Team with 135 votes. Due to the lockout, the 2011–12 season did not start until Christmas Day 2011. Blazer fans were hopeful that the three players advertised in their ""Rise With Us"" promotional campaign (Aldridge, Roy, and Greg Oden) would finally have a chance to play together for a ""full"" season. Those plans evaporated when Roy, who suffered from chronic knee problems due to the lack of cartilage in them, retired and Oden, who had only played in 82 games in the previous four seasons, had yet another setback in his effort to rehabilitate his knees. Aldridge was named a reserve on the Western Conference All-Star team in 2012. On November 12, 2012, Aldridge recorded a career-high eight assists in an 87-95 loss to the Atlanta Hawks. In 2013, Aldridge was named an All-Star for the second time in his career. He averaged 21.1 points per game, a career-high 9.1 rebounds per game and also recorded a career-high 2.6 assists per game in 37.7 minutes per game. The Trail Blazers went 33-49 and missed the playoffs for the second straight year. Despite trade rumors during the 2013 offseason, Aldridge voiced his desire to stay put in Portland, while also asking for improvements to the Blazers' roster. Aldridge started out his eighth NBA season strong, recording five straight double-doubles from November 9 to 17. On November 23, 2013, in a game against the Warriors, Aldridge was involved in an altercation after Warriors center Andrew Bogut became entangled with Joel Freeland. On November 25, it was announced that he was fined $45,000 for escalating the incident. The very same day, Aldridge was named Western Conference Player of the Week for the fourth time in his career. The award came in the midst of an 11-game win streak for the Blazers, during which Aldridge averaged 21.1 points, 11.3 rebounds, 2.5 assists, and 2.5 blocks per game. On December 12, 2013, Aldridge scored 31 points and grabbed a career-high 25 rebounds in a 111–104 victory over the Houston Rockets, becoming the first player in Portland Trail Blazers franchise history with at least 30 points and 25 rebounds in a game. On January 23, 2014, Aldridge recorded a career-high 44 points along with 13 rebounds, 5 assists and 2 blocks in a 110-105 victory over the Denver Nuggets. The Trail Blazers went 31-10 over the first half of the 2014 season, consistently staying near the top of the Western Conference through the first three months of the season, and making a push for a return to the playoffs. Alongside teammate Damian Lillard, Aldridge was voted in as a reserve for the 2014 NBA All-Star Game, his third straight appearance. He finished fifth in the frontcourt fan voting, garnering over 600,000 votes. Aldridge suffered a lower back contusion during the third quarter of a game versus the San Antonio Spurs on March 12, 2014. He missed the next seven games but returned in time to help the Blazers secure their 30th playoff berth and first since 2011. On April 20, 2014, Aldridge recorded a new career high and franchise playoff high of 46 points along with 18 rebounds, 2 assists, and 2 blocks in Game 1 of the opening round of the playoffs against the Houston Rockets which ended in a 122-120 overtime win for the Portland Trail Blazers. On April 23, 2014, in Game 2 of the Blazers' series against the Houston Rockets, Aldridge tallied 43 points and 8 rebounds. He joins Michael Jordan, Jerry West, Allen Iverson, and Tracy McGrady as the only players in NBA history to score 89 or more points in the first two games of a playoff series. Over the entire six-game series with Houston, Aldridge averaged 29.8 points and over 2.5 blocks per game. In the next series against the Spurs, Aldridge struggled, shooting only 41.7 percent from the field, as the Blazers were handily defeated in five games. Ultimately, Aldridge had a career season in 2014, winning three Western Conference Player of the Week awards, and recording career highs in points per game, rebounds per game, free-throw percentage, defensive rebounds, and double-doubles. On December 9, 2014, in a game against the Detroit Pistons, Aldridge passed Terry Porter for second on the franchise's all-time scoring list with 11,333 career points. After leading Portland over the first half of the season with averages of 23.2 points and 10.2 rebounds per game, Aldridge was ruled out for six to eight weeks on January 23, 2015, after tearing the radial collateral ligament in his left thumb. However, he missed just two games after deciding against surgery and returned to the starting lineup on January 24 against the Washington Wizards, scoring 26 points in a victory that followed two losses with him sidelined. After being selected as a frontcourt reserve to his fourth straight NBA All-Star Game appearance on January 29, Aldridge was named as a starter on February 14 by Western Conference All-Star head coach Steve Kerr, replacing the injured Anthony Davis. On March 20, 2015, Aldridge became the Trail Blazers' all-time leader in rebounds by recording 10 against the Orlando Magic. Meanwhile, however, the Blazers were cooling off after a 30-11 record through the first 41 games of the season when shooting guard Wesley Matthews, who Aldridge called ""the heart and soul"" of the Trail Blazers, tore his Achilles tendon on March 5 against the Dallas Mavericks and missed the rest of the season and playoffs, The Blazers subsequently went 21-20 through their final 41 games. In the playoffs, the short-handed Blazers were outplayed and outmatched by the Memphis Grizzlies in five games. Aldridge averaged a career-best 23.4 points per game, made a league-best 659 field goals, and was voted onto the All-NBA Second Team. On July 9, 2015, Aldridge signed a four-year, $80 million contract with the San Antonio Spurs. Upon being acquired by the Spurs, Aldridge was granted the number 12 jersey despite it having been retired for Bruce Bowen. Bowen gave Aldridge and the Spurs his blessing to unretire the number for him. He made his debut for the Spurs in the team's season opener on October 28 against the Oklahoma City Thunder. In just under 32 minutes of action, he recorded 11 points and 5 rebounds in a 112–106 loss. On November 11, he returned to Portland for the first time as a Spur, recording 23 points and 6 rebounds in a 113–101 win over his former team. On February 1, 2016, he scored a season-high 28 points in a 107–92 win over the Orlando Magic, helping the Spurs win its 35th straight home game (dating to March 2015), good for the sixth-best streak in league history. He topped his season-high mark two days later, scoring 36 points in a 110–97 win over the New Orleans Pelicans. With the win, the Spurs moved to 27–0 at home to start the season, snapping a tie with the 1977–78 Portland Trail Blazers for the best home start among Western Conference teams. On February 8, he was named the Western Conference Player of the Week for games played Monday, February 1 through Sunday, February 7. He averaged 26.0 points, 7.3 rebounds and 2.5 blocks while shooting .597 (37-62) from the field and .909 from the foul line to help the Spurs go 4–0 for the week. After dislocating his right pinkie finger on April 7, it bothered him for the rest of the regular season and into the playoffs.
